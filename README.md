## 🛠️ Work Experience

### 🧰 Tools Engineer & Art Director @ Mothware _(May 2024 – Present)_
- Created an auto-tiling module (Python → Lua) with edge and depth detection for level geometry. Cut level design time by 70%.
- Directed visual development: concept art, character animation, level assets, backgrounds.
- Designed 6 gameplay areas with distinct palettes and world-building motifs.

### 💻 Software Engineer Intern @ Sonic Incytes _(Jan 2023 – Aug 2023)_
- Built a Jenkins-powered testing pipeline with Python for hardware/GUI testing via machine vision.
- Improved system stability by enhancing C++ imaging software with connection tracking.
- Optimized AWS S3 patient data syncing; resolved desync issues.
- Refactored PDF report generation and anonymization logic.

## 🚀 Personal Projects

### 🧱 Realtime Rendering Pipeline _(TypeScript, Three.js, GLSL)_
- Built a voxel-based deferred render system with DDA raycasting for accurate point/infinite light shadows.
- Implemented real-time semi-Lagrangian fluid sim for volumetric mist affected by geometry and input.
- Designed for 2D artists to create 3D effects—no extra 3D tools needed.

### 🧠 Neural Image Classifier _(Java, JavaFX)_
- Developed an object-oriented neural net trained via mutation and evolution to differentiate images.
